The purpose of this program is to help the user manage an inventory of items. Each item will have a name(2-256 characters),
a serial number, and a value. The user can add, delete, and edit items. The user can search, sort, export, and load an 
inventory. At the time of export, the user can pick TSV(.txt), HTML(.html), or JSON(.json) for the format of the file and 
these types can all be loaded at a later time.
